# ðŸ“Š Fractional Bond Pricing API

A Flask-based API that calculates **fractional bond prices**, expected yields, and buyer interest projections.  
The system supports **different bond ratings (High-rated vs Low-rated)** and provides pricing logic based on **present value (PV) models** and **implied yield calculations**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Compute **present value (PV) pricing** for bonds.
- Estimate **implied yield** based on market price.
- Support for **fractional bond trading**. (default: 100 fractions per bond)
- **Buyer interest projections** for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year horizons.
- Separate handling of **high-rated** and **low-rated** bonds.
- Flask-based REST API with JSON responses.
